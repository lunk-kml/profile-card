### What I learned

- Wrap image in the <picture> element

- Using the <main> and <footer> in <body> to improve navigation and accessibility.

- Learned to make a picture look like a social media profile picture and also able to position on the header background image.

      ```css
      .profile {
        border-radius: 50%;
        border: 0.25rem solid white;
        object-fit: cover;
        margin: 5.4rem 7.7rem;

        position: absolute;
      }
      ```

### Continued development

- Need to be able to position the background image correctly.
- Need to be able to make texts elements appear next to each other without trouble. - inline, inline-block
